3. Install the app on your phone and run

4. Enter the game, put on your VR device, start, watch the balls which may move or float and click on the screen with your fingers to explode them.

## Notes

1. The main purpose of developing this game was to learn to develop a simple VR game and experience it, so the game is too simple but you can still have fun. 

2. The figures in the game may be unreasonable so do not be frustrated if you fail. But the most experienced player can still complete the game.

3. Some problems caused by the device or the game remain. You may find uncomfortable to click on the screen while gaming due to the cardboard and feel giddy due to VR game's immanent features and my design.
